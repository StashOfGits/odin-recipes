        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you love crunch, this recipe is for you! The chicken's swept with a
           tangy-sweet honey Dijon dressing, then sprinked with melty Monterey Jack 
           and crispy fried onions. When baked, the crust gets golden brown while 
           the meat stays juicy and tender. Add tender green beans and buttery garlic 
           bread to the mix for a winning dinner.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p class="steps">Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place 2 
                   tbsp butter in a small bowl and bring to room temperature. Pat chicken dry
                   with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper; place on one 
                   side of a baking sheet. Brush tops of chicken with 1/2 tbsp dressing each.
                   Sprinkle with Monterey Jack. Crush crispy onions, then sprinkle over cheese, 
                   pressing to adhere. Roast on middle rack for 5 minutes.
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="steps">Meanwhile, wash and dry produce. Trim green beans if necessary. Once chicken 
                   has roasted 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven. Carefully toss green beans on
                   empty side with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Return to middle rack until 
                   green beans are tender and chicken is browned and cooked through, 12-15 minutes 
                   more.
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="steps">Meanwhile, combine softened butter with garlic powder to taste. Season with salt 
                   and pepper. Half and toast ciabatta. Spread cut sides with garlic butter. Cut each 
                   half on a diagonal.
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="steps">Toss green beans with 1 tbsp plain butter until melted. Season with salt and pepper.
                   Divide chicken, green beans, and garlic bread between plates. Serve with the remaining 
                   dressing a on the side.
