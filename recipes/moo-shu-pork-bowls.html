        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Saucy, sweet, and spicy! Ground pork is browned with crisp cabbage and scallions, 
           then simmered in a bold, punchy sauce of hoisin, Thai chili sauce, sweet soy glaze,
           and lime juice. It's all spooned over buttery rice and garnished with sesame seeds 
           for a nutty crunch.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Wash and dry produce. In a small pot, combine rice, 1 1/2 cup water, and a
                   pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until 
                   rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve. Thinly 
                   slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Quarter lime.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook,
                   breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. 
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Stir scallion whites and cabbage into pan with pork; cook, stirring occasionally, 
                   until just tender, 2-3 minutes. Stir in hoisin, chili sauce, 2 1/2 tbsp sweet soy 
                   glaze, and 1/2 teaspoon sugar until thoroughly combined. Turn off heat. Taste and
                   season with juice from half the lime, salt, and pepper.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Fluff rice with a fork and stir in 1 tbsp butter until melted. Season with salt and
                   pepper. Divide rice between bowls and top with moo shu pork. Sprinkle with scallion 
                   greens and as many sesame seeds as you like. Serve with any remaining lime wedges on 
                   the side.
