        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Roast chicken with green sauce. Tender, juicy, and spiced just right. Served with
           garlic rice and garnished with tomatoes, scallions, and lime. The whole dish is
           topped off with the creamy sauce--tangy lime and a spicy kick from pickled
           jalapeno--to drizzle over every bite!

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p class="steps">Wash and dry produce. Peel and mince garlic; place a pinch of garlic in a small bowl and reserve for
                   step 5. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Thinly slice jalapeno into rounds,
                   removing ribs and seeds for less heat. Zest and quarter lime. Dice tomato into 1/2 inch pieces.
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="steps">Melt 1 tbsp butter in a small pot over medium heat; add scallion whites, remaining garlic, and 1 teaspoon
                   Fajita Spice Blend to pot. Cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, 2-3 minutes. Add rice, stock concentrate,
                   1 1/2 cup water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil; cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender,
                   15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="steps">In a second small microwave-safe bowl, combine jalapeno, juice from half the lime, 1/4 teaspoon sugar, and
                   a pinch of salt. Microwave for 30 seconds. Set aside to pickle, stirring ocasionally.
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="steps">Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Season all over with preferred amount of Fajita Spice Blend, salt, and pepper.
                   Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through,
                   3-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board to rest.
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="steps">While chicken cooks, remove jalapeno from pickling liquid. Reserve a few rounds for garnishing; mince remaining
                   jalapeno. To bowl with reserved garlic, add mayonaise, sour cream, a squeeze of lime juice, a big pinch of lime 
                   zest, and a pinch of minced jalapeno to taste. Add water 1 teaspoon at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling
                   consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="steps">Fluff rice with fork. Stir in tomato, half the scallion greens, remaining lime zest, and as much remaining minced 
                   jalapeno as you like. Season with salt and pepper. Thinly slice chicken crosswise. Divide rice between bowls and 
                   top with chicken. Squeeze juice from remaining lime over chicken. Drizzle everything with creamy salsa verde; garnish 
                   with remaining scallion greens and as many reserved jalapeno rounds as you like. Serve.
